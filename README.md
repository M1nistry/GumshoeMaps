Path of Exile Map Logging

This tool is aimed to replace people using Google docs to manually track their maps and the returns. It's still reasonably early days, however there are lots of ideas and features in mind to make it a very powerful tool.

It uses SQLite to database the maps and their details. Additionally you will be able to opt-in to have your map data anonymously published to a MySQL server to do league wide analysis.

**Working Features**
- Logging maps you have ran, including their quantity, quality, rarity and affixes.
- Logging the map drops attatched to a map ran (currency and uniques)
- Duration of a running map
- Logging map drops from Zana and Cartographers found
- Experience gained per map (including a smaller percent of level eg. 0.64% of a level)
- Adding notes to each map (eg. Shav's dropped for some guy in this map / X died from Y in here)
- Customizable hotkeys for stoping maps/zana/cartos etc.

**Planned Features**
- Zana Dailies
- Reporting to spreadsheet/Google docs to share your results.
