Path of Exile Map Logging

This tool is aimed to replace people using Google docs to manually track their maps and the returns. It's still reasonably early days, however there are lots of ideas and features in mind to make it a very powerful tool.

It uses SQLite to database the maps and their details.

**Working Features**
- Logging maps you have ran, including their quantity, quality, rarity and affixes.
- Logging the map drops attatched to a map ran
- Duration of a running map
- Logging map drops from Zana and Cartographers found
- Logging notable drops (Currency, Uniques, etc)

**Planned Features**
- Zana Dailies
- Reporting to spreadsheet/Google docs to share your results.
- Experience gained per map.
